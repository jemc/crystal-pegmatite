# TokenIterator is used to traverse a flat array of Tokens as if it were a tree.
#
# Child tokens in the tokens array are represented as tokens that follow after
# their parent in the array and have an offset range whose finish offset is
# less than or equal to the the finish offset of the parent.
#
# TokenIterator is aware of this relationship and can be used to easily
# traverse them, given a little discipline on the part of the caller.
# In particular, the caller must commit to consuming tokens in a depth-first
# traversal pattern in order for child relationships to be propery observed.
#
# See spec/fixtures/json.cr for a real-world example of using TokenIterator.
